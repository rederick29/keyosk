        <x-testimonials.testimonial-card rating="10" subject="<3" comment="I really love Keyosk. Like, a lot. Like, a whole lot. You have no idea. I love it so much that it is inexplicable, and I'm ninety-nine percent sure that I have an unhealthy obsession. I will never get tired of browing this sweet, awesome e-commerce website. It is my life goal to meet up with the developers in real life and just say hello to them.
I fall asleep at night dreaming of them making an admin account for me, and then they would be enhusiastic that they would give me a special discount. If I could have access to the Keyosk beta version for a brief moment, I could die happy. If given the opportunity, I would perform full systems and integration testing on this website just to see how well its made. Then, I would send the devs emails while they are hoping that I would stop, but I only continue as the website gets better and better.
I would give up almost anything just for the Keyosk devs to look in my general direction. No matter what I do, I am constantly thinking of Keyosk. When I wake up, Keyosk is the first thing on my mind. When I go to school, I can only focus on Keyosk. When I go come home, I go on the computer so that I can browse this beautiful website. When I go to sleep, I dream of the Keyosk homepage. Keyosk is my pride, passion, and joy. If keyosk were to give me a 'special' account, I would probably get diabetes from the devs' sweetness and die.
I wish for nothing but Keyosk profits. If it were for Keyosk, I would give my life without any second thoughts. Without Keyosk, my life would serve no purpose. I really love Keyosk." name="Jane Doe"></x-testimonials.testimonial-card>
